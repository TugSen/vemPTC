# vemPTC
**************************************************************************

 vemPTC IS A PARABOLIC TROUGH SOLAR COLLECTOR DYNAMIC THERMAL SIMULATION TOOL 
 DEVELOPED BASED ON THE VOLUME ELEMENT MODEL. THE TOOL COMPRISES A POLAR MESH
 GENERATION TOOL AND SOLVER THAT INCLUDES APPROPRIATE EQUATIONS. THE TOOL 
 REQUIRES CoolProp AND OpenMP TO OBTAIN THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE HEAT
 TRANSFER FLUID AND FOR PARALLEL PROCESSING, RESPECTIVELY. THE LIBRARIES 
 CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM:

	CoolProp - http://coolprop.org/
	OpenMP - http://openmp.org/wp/

 IF SERIAL COMPUTATION IS DESIRED, DISABLE OpenMP FROM THE MAKEFILE.
 THE SOLUTION IS EXPORTED AS .TXT AND .VTK FILES FOR POST-PROCESSING AND
 VISUALIZATION PURPOSES.
